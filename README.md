a simple and easy to-do list website to note down your tasks for the day. Add, update, and delete tasks on the go.

## features

- easy to navigate
- edit/update tasks
- delete tasks individually
- delete every task instantly

## brief description

this is a revamped version of one of my front end web development assignments in university. We were required to make a to-do list website with DOM HTML using JavaScript and create user interactions using `.addEventListener()`. The CSS is not responsive yet, so it may look off in certain devices.

## languages used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## bugs/things to be fixed/added

- not responsive yet (looks terrible on mobile)
- the to-do list may look off center on some devices
- making the UI more comfortable to the user, e.g. pressing  `enter` to immediately input the task as opposed to pressing a button.

## extras
