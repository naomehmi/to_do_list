## brief description

this is a revamped version of one of my front end web development assignments in university. We were required to make a to-do list website with DOM HTML using JavaScript and create user interactions using `.addEventListener()`. The CSS is not responsive yet, so it may look off in certain devices.

## languages used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## bugs/things to be fixed/added

- checkbox
- date and time
- alarm/notification
- let user add extra information/details to their tasks
- animations
